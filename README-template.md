## My process



### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

- How to create a proper README! This is something I hadn't done until this project. This template comes from [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). 
- Creating a customizeable responsive hamburger menu with a brand name. 
- How to create slightly transparent divs with background-color and an rbga value, the a value with adjust the opacity of the color. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable on JavaScript. I feel like I need functions broken down even more or even illustrated to me. 

### Useful resources

- [Codewithfaraz.com - How to Create a Responsive Navbar with Hamburger Menu Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript ](https://www.codewithfaraz.com/content/65/how-to-create-a-responsive-navbar-with-hamburger-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript) 
- This helped me create a navigation bar that is responsive and smooth. I wrote each line-by-line instead of copy and pasting, refreshing my live browser to see how each component fit together. 


- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
